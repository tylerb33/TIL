### Setting the upstream of a branch

- Use the ```git remote set-url``` command for this. It takes two arguments:

An existing remote name. For example, ```origin``` or ```upstream``` are two common choices.

A new URL for the remote. For example, this is a complete command: ``` git remote set-url origin https://github.com/tylerb33/TIL.git ```
