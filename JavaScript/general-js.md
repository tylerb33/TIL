### A place for general Javascript notes

**Prototype**

All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype.

Date objects inherit from Date.prototype. Array objects inherit from Array.prototype. Person objects inherit from Person.prototype.

The Object.prototype is on the top of the prototype inheritance chain: Date objects, Array objects, and Person objects inherit from Object.prototype.
