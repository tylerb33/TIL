**Benefits of ASP.NET MVC**

* Makes it easier to manage complexity by dividing an application into the model, the view, and the controller.

* Enables full control over the rendered HTML and provides a clean separation of concerns.

* Direct control over HTML also means better accessibility for implementing compliance with evolving Web standards.

* Facilitates adding more interactivity and responsiveness to existing apps.

* Provides better support for test-driven development (TDD).

* Works well for Web applications that are supported by large teams of developers and for Web designers who need a high degree of control over the application behavior.
